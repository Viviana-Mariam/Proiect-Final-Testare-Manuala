# Final_Project_Manual_Testing
### Introduction
---
The scope of the final project is to use all gained knowledge throught the course and apply them in practice, using a live application.

Application under test: [OrangeHRM](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login)
(User Management submodule, Job submodule and Organization/General Information submodule)
